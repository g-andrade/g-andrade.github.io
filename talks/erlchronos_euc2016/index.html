`erlchronos`: A gen_server wrapper with ticks

<br><br>

* *erlang:send_after/3* approach is very susceptible to jitter on processes that receive a lot of messages

* We could pattern match directly over the process inbox, effectively turning into a priority queue

* But this is very inefficient and performance would suffer the more the inbox grew

* Regular gen_server callbacks support specifying an extra 'timeout' value on return, which gets fed directly to the receive/after clause deep inside the gen_server code
```erlang
% [...]
loop(Parent, Name, State, Mod, Time, Debug) ->
    Msg = receive
	      Input ->
		    Input
	  after Time ->
		  timeout
	  end,
% [...]
```

* Maybe we can use this to trigger our timers on idle periods
* ...and busy waiting to cover more the active periods

## Example ##

```erlang
-module(simple_tick).
-behaviour(ticked_gen_server).
% [...]

start_link() ->
    ticked_gen_server:start_link(?MODULE, [], [{ticks, ["a simple tick"]}]).

% [...]

tick_duration("a simple tick", State) ->
    % duration in milliseconds
    {50, State}.

% [...]

handle_tick(TickId, TickGeneration, ActualTickDuration, State) ->
    io:format("tick! ~p / ~p in ~pms", 
              [TickId, TickGeneration, ActualTickDuration]),
    %
    % tick! "a simple tick" / 0 in 0ms
    % tick! "a simple tick" / 1 in 50ms
    % tick! "a simple tick" / 2 in 49ms
    % tick! "a simple tick" / 3 in 50ms
    %   ...
    {noreply, State}.

% [...]
```

### Pros:
* Ticks should be more precise - save for flooded inboxes
* Tick duration can be dinamycally adjusted on overload
* Ticking logic is abstracted away

### Cons:
* Slight execution overhead
* Losing the ability of specifying timeouts on regular gen_server callbacks
* Losing the ability of receiving messages made only of the atom 'timeout'

### Unsolved problems:
* Jitter introduced by events that take too much time to handle
* Tick burst if the process execution is blocked for a while
